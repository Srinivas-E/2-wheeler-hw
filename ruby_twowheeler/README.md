# TwoWheeler API & CLI
This is simple API in Ruby for TwoWheeler and command line interface build upon
this API. Communication is done over Bluetooth using command set
[implemented on balancer](../sw_twowheeler/app_balancer/README.md)
itself.

Just to make a note - Ruby is executed on your computer, balancer
accepts only simple command set. Balancing and other actions are
computed inside XMOS, not on the computer.
