# TwoWheeler
TwoWheeler is Self Balancing Robot implemented using [XMOS startKIT](http://www.xmos.com/startkit) platform.

The robot is solving physical problem of inverted pendulum using PID regulator connecting motors with accelerometer. However its hardware design has much more features:
* 8 core 32-bit microcontroller
* bluetooth transceiver
* two distance meters
* motor driver with current sensing
* buck converter designed for use with LiPo battery
* battery voltage monitoring
* Over-The-Air parameters programming to built-in flash
* high torque motors with encoders

## Parts

* XMOS firmware - more in [balancer README](sw_twowheeler/app_balancer/README.md)
* computer app - API available in Ruby and console command interface with scripting (more in [documentation](ruby_twowheeler/README.md))
* circuit schematic and PCB design
* hardware design - not yet documented
